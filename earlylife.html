<h3>Birth of Samuel</h3>
<p title="birth"><img src="hannah.jpg" id="han">
Samuel's birth was a special one. Hannah, Samuel's mother, was unable to have children. However, she had great faith 
in God and prayed for a child.
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+1%3A10-11&version=NIV">
<u>1 Samuel 1:10-11</u><br>
<sup>10</sup>In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to the Lord, weeping bitterly. <sup>11</sup>And she made a vow, 
saying, &ldquo;Lord Almighty, if you will only look on your servant&rsquo;s misery and remember me, and not forget your 
servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the Lord for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever 
be used on his head.&rdquo;
</blockquote>
God heard Hannah's plead and gave her a son, and after she weaned him, she brought Samuel to the temple to 
stay with Eli.
<h3>God Calls Samuel</h3>
<p title="Call of Samuel"><img src="youngsam.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right:17px" width="302" height="200">
When sleeping, Samuel hears a voice calling to him, &ldquo;Samuel!&rdquo; He runs to Eli to see what he wanted, but Eli tells Samuel 
that he did not call him and that God may be calling him. He tells him to answer God. When Samuel does, God tells him 
that he was going to bring judgement to Eli&rsquo;s household. After this message, God continues to talk to Samuel, and 
people realize that he is God&rsquo;s chosen prophet.
