<p title="Intro"><img src="sam4.jpeg" id="sam4">
<span style="font-size: 35px; font-weight: bold">SAMUEL</span> is one of the most well-known prophets of the bible.
Samuel is known as the prophet who lived during the years of Israel's transition from a God-led theocracy, with
judges chosen by God, to a monarchy, where the king's son would inherit the throne and become the next king.
</p>
<br>
<p title="Problems"><img src="sam5.jpg" id="sam5">
After changing over from a theocracy to a monarchy, there were problems. Saul, the first king, started of as a good
king, but after experiencing the benefits and luxuries of kingship, he started to disobey God's commands and fall
away from God.
